tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ

And they are estimated in diffrent signals ,we chose only

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation


subjet
================

subject column record the subject number of each record

activity
===============
activity indicate what status of the subject is in of the record they include:

WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING



averageby_subject_activity.csv

this csv file count the average value of each column in tidyexperimentdata.csv according to different subject in different activity status

resultreqested.tab is just another format edition of averageby_subject_activity.csv
